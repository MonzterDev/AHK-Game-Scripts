## Auction Pricer

![Auction Pricer video](../Media/D&D%20Auction%20Pricer.gif)

This script is used to easily price items on the marketplace. It grabs a selected item's name, rarity, & enchantments and then automatically puts that information into the market tab for you.

### How to use

1. Download the `Auction Pricer.exe` file from the [releases](https://github.com/MonzterDev/AHK-Game-Scripts/releases/) page and run it
2. Go to the marketplace and select the "My Listings" tab
3. Hover over the item you want to price (Must be inside the Stash section)
4. Press the hotkey (Default is `F3`)
5. The script will automatically fill in the item's name, rarity, and enchantments

The most important thing about the current setup is that the script was made using a 1920 x 1080 resolution. I plan on adjusting the script in the future to avoid this.

## Druid Swap Keybinds

This script is used to bind Druid forms to keys and instantly swap between them.
